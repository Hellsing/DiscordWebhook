# DiscordWebhook
Discord webhook library in C# [Updated]

## Features
The ability to send Webhooks without being rate-limited. In the past, there were more features that you can probably see from the fork created **5 years ago**, unfortunately, they were removed since they became a bit outdated. This is the improved and one of the recent ways to send a webhook message.

## Changes
